		<p>I am a licensed radio amateur since 2010. I got my class E license (CEPT Novice License) and my callsign DO4NE when I was 16 years old.</p>
		<p>After pausing the hobby for several years due to my study of computer science, my first job and shifted interests, I am active again since 2020.</p>

		<h2>Activity</h2>
		<p>SSB and CW are my preferred modes!</p>
		<p>I am working with computers the whole day, so I like it simple and old-fashioned when it comes to amateur radio. Digimodes are not that fascinating for me, they are quite impersonal, especially when you are sending just macros. I like "handmade" voice or morse communication.</p>
		<p>As cities are full of QRM and having not enough space for shortwave antennas, I love to operate QRP and portable from outdoor. Outdoor operation has the nice sideeffect of some publicity for this special hobby.</p>
		<p>Because I operate portable from outdoor locations and while travelling, I like to keep my equipment lightweight and minimalistic. I do not want to carry a laptop or tablet, connecting interfaces and cables with me.</p>
		<p>Now in the solar minimum and having strong QRM at my city QTH, I also found interest in the field of satellite communication. In a first step I want to try operating LEO satellites with my handheld transceiver and a portable duoband Yagi.</p>
